# The Story so Far...

The year is 202020, and Earth Force Captain, *Chough-Chough* (That’s you!) is returning to base after another successful mission. Star Gazer 1, An earth outpost, had been the captain’s home away from home for some time now. The Garquackien threat necessitated round the clock vigil, and Earth Force Captain *Chough-Chough* had been tasked with maintaining that vigil throughout the neutral space separating The United Earth Force from the Garquackien empire and its quest for galactic domination. As the ship approached the Captain was looking forward to some well-deserved R&R when studently…

Several Garquackien attack ships appear out of nowhere. To make matters worse the there is no sign of Star gazer 1 but dust and debris. The Garquackiens would have had to muster an enormous armada to mount this kind of attack, and the captain knew that an armada that size could only have one target…Earth. The Garquackiens had come to make good on their plans for galaxy wide dominion and will likely succeed if the Earth Force is not warned in time. Your crew, and resources have already been taxed from the previous mission, and yet a new mission has already begun.

Your mission is to reach Earth before the Garquackien invasion and warn Space Force about the impending attack. Should you fail, it is likely that Earth will suffer the same fate as Star Gazer 1.
